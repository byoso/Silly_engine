# Silly Engine

It is a bunch of easy-to-handle tools to create quickly python terminal interfaces, nothing too fancy, considering this:
- keep it simple
- keep it light
- no tier library import ! all included.

**The demos included in this repo are the documentation.**

## Includes

- **minuit.py**: the TUI tools (handle forms, arrays, menus...)
- **router.py**: an alternative to argparse based on routes instead of flags
- **logger.py**: a pre-built logger
- **jsondb.py**: NOSQL-like interface for a json storage.
- **text_tools.py**: I admit this one is fancy (see the title on top of this page ?), requires an ascii map (like the one following)
- **ascii_map_01.py**: you could create your own, if so 2 rules:
    - create at least a character for "space"
    - all your letters must have the same number of lines.

## Expected use

Copy/paste the Silly Engine in your porject. Then use it, the code is simple enought to be modified it if you want to. Fork it, customize it, make it yours, or just use it as it comes. Enjoy :)
